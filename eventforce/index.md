# EventForce – SNHU CS499 Capstone
_EventForce_ is a cross-platform event management app originally built in Java for Android and later enhanced and ported to Swift for iOS. It features user profile–based event filtering, secure login, and cloud database integration.

This artifact was selected and enhanced to demonstrate my proficiency in:

- **Software Design & Engineering**
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**
- **Databases**

## Enhancement Narratives by Category

### 1. Software Design & Engineering

- **Enhancement Summary:**  
  Ported the Android version of EventForce to iOS using Swift and SwiftUI. Re-architected the UI and model layers to align with iOS development practices and integrated Firebase Authentication and Firestore.

- **Branch:** [`category-1-software-design-and-engineering`](https://github.com/jvil-dev/EventForce/tree/category-1-software-design-and-engineering)

- **Narrative:** [View README Narrative](https://github.com/jvil-dev/EventForce/blob/category-1-software-design-and-engineering/README.md)

### 2. Algorithms & Data Structures

- **Enhancement Summary:**  
  Added keyword-based event filtering, improved performance by linking events to selected user profiles, and optimized state management in Swift to handle UI responsiveness and data flow.

- **Branch:** [`category-2-algorithms-datastructures`](https://github.com/jvil-dev/EventForce/tree/category-2-algorithms-datastructures)

### 3. Databases

- **Enhancement Summary:**  
  Migrated from local SQLite on Android to Firebase Firestore in iOS. Implemented Firestore rules to enforce secure, user-specific event access, and made data persistent across devices.
