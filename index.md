## Professional Self-Assessment

Since beginning my computer science journey in February 2022, I have come to understand that this discipline is fundamentally about more than just writing code; it is about creatively engineering solutions that serve a real-world purpose. My time at SNHU has been focused on developing not only the technical skills required of a developer but also the critical thinking and problem-solving abilities needed to build effective, secure, and user-friendly software. My ultimate career goal is to become a developer for music notation software, where I can merge my technical expertise with my lifelong passion as a classically trained violinist and composer to create tools that empower artists.

This program has prepared me to enter the computer science field by providing hands-on experience in several key areas:

* **Software Engineering and Databases:** I have demonstrated the ability to analyze and modernize a legacy application, migrating it from a monolithic Android architecture to a modular, scalable MVVM pattern in Swift. A crucial part of this was re-architecting the database, moving from an insecure local SQLite implementation to a robust, cloud-based Firestore backend. This process highlights my skills in full-stack development, ensuring that both the client-side and server-side of an application are well-designed and work in harmony.

* **Data Structures, Algorithms, and Security:** I believe that performance and security are pillars of good software. In enhancing EventForce, I designed and implemented a client-side filtering algorithm to provide a responsive user experience, a significant improvement over the original version's database-query approach. More importantly, I addressed a critical security flaw by replacing a plaintext password system with Firebase Authentication. My experience debugging and implementing user-specific Firestore security rules further underscores my commitment to protecting user data.

* **Collaboration and Communication:** Throughout my academic career, I have learned that collaborating within a team and communicating effectively with stakeholders are as important as any technical skill. Documenting my enhancement plan, producing a code review video, and writing detailed narratives have honed my ability to articulate complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.
