## Professional Self-Assessment

Since beginning my computer science journey in February 2022, my coursework at SNHU has taught me that this discipline is fundamentally about more than just writing code; it is about creatively engineering solutions that serve a real-world purpose. My academic program has been focused on developing not only the technical skills required of a developer but also the critical thinking and problem-solving abilities needed to build effective, secure, and user-friendly software. My ultimate career goal is to become a developer for music notation software, where I can merge the technical expertise gained in my degree with my lifelong passion as a classically trained violinist and composer.

This capstone, and my program as a whole, has prepared me to enter the computer science field by providing hands-on experience in several key areas:

* **Software Engineering and Databases:** My studies have provided me with a strong foundation in the complete software development lifecycle, from initial design to deployment and maintenance. I am proficient in applying modern architectural patterns like MVVM to build clean, scalable, and maintainable applications. My experience extends to database design and implementation, where I have learned to work with both local relational databases and scalable, cloud-based NoSQL solutions, understanding the critical trade-offs between them.

* **Data Structures, Algorithms, and Security:** My work with algorithms and data structures has focused on implementing efficient solutions for searching, sorting, and managing data to create responsive and performant applications. A core component of my education has been developing a security-first mindset. This includes understanding the principles of secure authentication, data privacy, and writing code that anticipates and mitigates potential vulnerabilities to protect user data and system resources.

* **Collaboration and Communication:** Throughout my academic career, I have learned that collaborating within a team and communicating effectively with stakeholders are as important as any technical skill. Documenting my enhancement plan, producing a code review video, and writing detailed narratives have honed my ability to articulate complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.

**Introduction to _EventForce_:** The skills I have outlined are best demonstrated through practical application. To that end, the technical portion of this portfolio is presented as a single, comprehensive case study: the enhancement of the EventForce application. By re-engineering this one project across three distinct categories—software design, algorithms, and databases—I was able to tell a cohesive story of modernizing a legacy Android application into a secure and robust iOS platform. The following project page provides tangible evidence of my skills, represents the culmination of my academic learning, and showcases my readiness to contribute to the software development field.
